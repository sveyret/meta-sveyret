# Note

This recipe was taken from a patch provided by Robert Joslyn. The patch was submitted to the Yocto project in (this e-mail)[https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-devel/message/100934] and should be merged to the `meta-java` official repository.

The recipes from this directory will be removed when the patch will be merged to the official repository.

Anyway, this version adds a provider definition as java2-runtime.
